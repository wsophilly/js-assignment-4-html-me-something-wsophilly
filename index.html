					<h2>This is the Beginning</h2>
					<p>THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF JEVON’S 1ST HAIRCUT EXPERIENCE.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Jevon has realized that his Dad (whom he likes)
                  has hired some clown to do something to him but he is not exactly sure
                  what it is. </p>

					<h2>Jevon Begins Processing</h2>
					<p>JEVON IS NOT HAPPY AND HE IS ALSO AN EAGLES FAN.</p> 
               <br>
               <p>It is not lost on Jevon that the Clown his Dad has hired is a Cowboys Fan (as noted by the stop sign decal on the wall).  
               <p>Jevon is processing everything that is wrong with what is happening in his life right now - as the haircut begins.
               <p>(In hindsight if his Dad had realized said clown was a Cowboys Fan, he would not have hired him either.) </p>

               <p>He's not sure what type of gangster, maybe a Blood or a Crip, or if he can somehow join the Mafia, </p> 
               <p> but he knows he has options and his mind is made up.  He will be a gangster.</p>

               <p>but he will also have to murder his Dad as well and while he is angry enough to do it, </p> 
               <p>it also made him sad (cuz he has a brother and 2 sisters).</p>

					<h2>The Bribe and Selfie</h2>
					<p>Later that evening after the trauma has worn down, Jevons Dad offered him a very well timed Bribe </p>
               <p>of a vanilla Shake and McDonalds fries. The plan worked and Jevon poses and smiles for a selfie with his Dad.</p> 
               <p>All plans to one day murder his father were called off.   </p>
               <p>The Clown / barbers life is spared as well but conditional on never seeing him on the street again.</p>

					<h2>7 YEARS LATER</h2>
					<p>In order to protect innocent Barbers / Clowns from catching a stray, Jevon's Dad learned it would wiser to learn how to cut his hair himself.</p>
               <p>He spend $400 on clippers during the pandemic and watched a ton of Youtube videos.  He now cuts his son's Hair every other week in their own home.</p>  
               <p>He is not very good yet but he has a couple of years before his son really cares who cuts his hair.</p>   
               <p>He even made a 1 min Tik Tok style video to see if it would be a viable business venture one day.</p>
