                  THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF JEVON’S 1ST HAIRCUT EXPERIENCE.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Jevon has realized that his Dad (whom he likes)
                  has hired some clown to do something to him but he is not exactly sure
                  what it is.

           <p class="funparagraph">JEVON IS NOT HAPPY AND HE IS ALSO AN EAGLES FAN.</p> 
           <br>
               <div style="background: rgba(246, 250, 1, 0.463);

                       margin: 10px;">       
                  It is not lost on Jevon that the Clown his Dad has hired is a Cowboys Fan (as noted by the stop sign decal on the wall).
                  <br> 
                  <br>
                  Jevon is processing everything that is wrong with what is happening in his life right now - as the haircut begins.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  (In hindsight if his Dad had realized said clown was a Cowboys Fan, he would not have hired him either.)

                       margin: 10px;"> 
					Halfway during the haircut, Jevon decides to stare at the clown very intently.  We can only assume he is trying to make sure he remembers exactly what he looks like.

               <br> He has decided that he will become a gangster. 
               He's not sure what type of gangster, maybe a Blood or a Crip, or if he can somehow join the Mafia,  
               but he knows he has options and his mind is made up. 
               <br>

               He will be a gangster.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  but he will also have to murder his Dad as well.

                  <br>
                  While he is definitely angry enough to do it, 
                  it also made him sad (cuz he has a brother and 2 sisters).

               He has been told that the Experience is over.

					Later that evening after the trauma has worn down, Jevons Dad offered him a very well timed Bribe 
               of a vanilla Shake and McDonalds fries. The plan worked and Jevon poses and smiles for a selfie with his Dad.
               <br>
               <br>
               All plans to one day murder his father were called off.

					In order to protect innocent Barbers / Clowns from catching a stray, Jevon's Dad learned it would wiser to learn how to cut his hair himself.
               <br>
               <br>
               He spend $400 on clippers during the pandemic and watched a ton of Youtube videos.  
               <br>
               <br>
               He now cuts his son's Hair every other week in their own home.  
               He is not very good yet but he has a couple of years before his son really cares who cuts his hair.  
               He even made a 1 min Tik Tok style video to see if it would be a viable business venture one day.
